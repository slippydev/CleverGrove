    Quick Start Guide\nIntroduction\nPage 4\n Hope Inhumanity is a cooperative card-based game for 3 to 5 players, and it will take one to two hours to complete. To play, you will need the game cards, available for purchase online through hope-inhumanity.com, and a lot of six-sided dice approximately 8 per player.\nWhat's Included?\n 43 Scene Cards\n 13 Asset Cards\n 10 Relationship Cards\n 26 Trait Cards\n 10 Condition Cards\n 5 Humanity Dice Cards\n 1 Hope Dice Pool Card\nWhat Else You Need\n Eight (8) uniquely colored Humanity dice for each player.\n Seven (7) dice of another color for Hope dice.\n Scrap paper to note character information or game details.\n A few dice or tokens to count rounds and track Asset usage.\nGame Setup\nCard Setup\n Each player places a Humanity dice card in front of them.\n Place the Hope dice card in the center of the table.\n Write details like name, age, and a short description of your character on a scrap of paper.\nHope Dice Pool\n To seed the Hope dice pool, place on the Hope dice card as many dice as there are players.\nIntroduce your character to the other players. Discuss your characters background and how they all relate to one another. Use Traits and Relationships as prompts.\nRound Sequence\nThe game plays out over the course of five rounds. Play proceeds clockwise.\nTurn Sequence\n Split Scene cards into shuffled mini-decks, one for each terrain type.\n Place Asset cards in a pile near the Scene decks.\n Place Hunger and Harm condition cards nearby you're\ngoing to need them.\n Set aside the remaining Trait and Relationship cards.\nEach Player:\n\nOn your turn, draw a Scene card. Silently read to yourself the scenario outlined on it.\nChoose whether you will Act or Avoid. Scene cards tagged as Unavoidable must be Acted upon.\nIf you decide to Act, read or interpret for everyone the callout text at the top of the card, omitting the Refuse, Succeed, Fail or Accept details.\nIf no dice roll is necessary, each player chooses in turn how they will respond to the Scene. Hand out rewards and penalties according to the card text. The turn ends.\nIf there is a Hardship rating on the Scene card, then a dice roll is necessary. Commit one or more of your Humanity dice toward resolving the Scene. Push those dice to the middle of the table.\nOther players decide whether they support you, and they may describe how, if they wish. If they support you, they decide how much Humanity to commit. They support you with as many dice as they like, but they cannot exceed the amount you have committed. They add their committed dice to yours in the middle of the table. Players who want to support you but have no Humanity left can invoke the Last Hope rule at this time to use one (1) Hope die instead of Humanity.\nYou now have the option to use one or more dice from the Hope dice pool.\nCalculate the total hardship by adding to the Scene hardship any Harm and Hunger condition penalties you're suffering. Do not apply any helpers condition penalties. Then apply any relevant Relationship effects and decide if you'll use a Trait.\nRoll all the dice you've amassed. Count the successes 4s, 5s, and 6s.

Otherwise, you fail.\n Players who refused to support you suffer the Refuse penalty.\n If you succeed, any committed Humanity dice are lost. Set them aside and return the support dice to the other players to be set aside, also. You and everyone who supported you gain the Succeed benefits of the Scene card.\n If the Scene ends in failure, committed Humanity dice are lost. Set them aside and return the support dice to the other players to be set aside, also. You and those who supported you suffer the Fail penalty as defined on the Scene card.\nPage 5\n Unless a Scene card is marked Unavoidable, you may choose to Avoid a Scene card you've drawn. In this case, discard the Scene card and everyone (including you) suffers the Refuse penalty for that Scene. Your turn is over and play proceeds with the player to your left.\nThe End of the Round\nA round ends when all players have taken a
